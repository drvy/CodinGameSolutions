/**
 * In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the 
 * closest to zero.
 * 
 * Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. 
 * If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be 
 * considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, 
 * then display 5).
 * 
 * Game Input
 * Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result 
 * on the standard output.
 * 
 * Input:
 * Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze
 * Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging 
 * from -273 to 5526
 * 
 * Output:
 * Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the 
 * temperature closest to 0.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 0 â‰¤ N < 10000
