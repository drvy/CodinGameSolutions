/**
 * MIME types are used in numerous internet protocols to associate a media type 
 * (html, image, video ...) with the content sent. The MIME type is generally 
 * inferred from the extension of the file to be sent. You have to write a 
 * program that makes it possible to detect the MIME type  of a file based on 
 * its name.
 * 
 * You are provided with a table which associates MIME types to file extensions. 
 * You are also given a list of names of files to be transferred and for each 
 * one of these files, you must find the MIME type to be used. The extension of 
 * a file is defined as the substring which follows the last occurrence, if any, 
 * of the dot character within the file name.
 * 
 * If the extension for a given file can be found in the association table 
 * (case insensitive, e.g. TXT is treated the same way as txt), then print the 
 * corresponding MIME type. If it is not possible to find the MIME type 
 * corresponding to a file, or if the file doesnâ€™t have an extension, print 
 * UNKNOWN.
 * 
 * Input:
 * Line 1: Number N of elements which make up the association table.
 * 
 * Line 2: Number Q of file names to be analyzed.N following lines: 
 * One file extension per line and the corresponding MIME type 
 * (separated by a blank space).
 * 
 * Q following lines: One file name per line.
 * 
 * Output:
 * For each of the Q filenames, display on a line the corresponding MIME type. 
 * If there is no corresponding type, then display UNKNOWN.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 0 < N < 10000 
 * 0 < Q < 10000
 * File extensions are composed of a maximum of 10 alphanumerical ASCII.
 * MIME types are composed of a maximum 50 alphanumerical and punctuation ASCII.
 * File names are composed of a maximum of 256 alphanumerical ASCII and dots (.)
 * There are no spaces in the file names, extensions or MIME types.
